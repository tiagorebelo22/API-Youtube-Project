Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes what Fallen Order did and wall-runs with it, then double-jumps and air-dashes straight into an epic lightsaber battle. Rather than taking us back to square one to begin Cal’s journey as a Padawan again, we’re trusted with control of a full-fledged Jedi Knight who we can grow into a master of superhuman mobility and fantastic and challenging combat. With a new set of larger, more diverse, and densely packed worlds to explore and a memorable cast of returning characters, Survivor tells a story that may be predictable at times but is still fun and emotional to watch play out. Launch performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars game. If Respawn makes one more like this it’ll be the best Star Wars trilogy in 30 years, hands down."

Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.Worlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? “The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”).

It gives MPs the chance to put questions to the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak MP, or a nominated minister.  In most cases, the session starts with a routine 'open question' from an MP about the Prime Minister's engagements. MPs can then ask supplementary questions on any subject, often one of current political significance.  The Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir Starmer MP, asks six questions and the leader of the second largest opposition party asks two. If another minister takes the place of the Prime Minister, opposition parties will usually nominate a shadow minister to ask the questions.Want to find out more about what's happening in the House of Commons this week?

The youngest of King Triton’s daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life – and her father’s crown – in jeopardy. The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) as the voice of Sebastian; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca”) as the voice of Flounder; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.       “The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”) with a screenplay by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”). The songs feature music from multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”) and lyrics by Howard Ashman, and new lyrics by three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), Miranda, two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), and Rob Marshall, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer.

It's time for my annual bath - and for such an occasion, we decided to travel to most famous geothermal spa in Iceland - the Blue Lagoon. I've been wanting to unleash an international spa travel series for a long time - so here is my formal declaration: it's spa time, baby! So this past January, as the first installment of a 3-part Nordic/Scandinavian travel trip, we journeyed to the beautiful, mineral-rich light blue waters of the Blue Lagoon - to soak, smoothie, and face mask, oh my. Will this magical lagoon keep my skin plump and youthful forever? Or will the lava rock exfoliate my face right off? Who knows! Quick note - we mentioned that the Reykjanes lava field was 800 years old - I think it's actually much, much older than that - but the earliest recorded eruption was about 800 years ago (which is where our fact came from)!This video is NOT sponsored!Check out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.comMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​My TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?Tyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQwOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbigMUSICVia AudioNetworkPRODUCED & EDITED bySafiya NygaardTyler WilliamsDave SzametMelissa DouglasPhil KinneyBree von BradskyElizabeth PinottiAndrew LainhartIshara MathewsGFX by Dayana EspinozaCHAPTERS:0:00 Intro1:58 Flying to Iceland3:27 A Jet-lagged Day in Reykjavík5:46 The Blue Lagoon Retreat Hotel7:46 Prepping for the Blue Lagoon9:30 Dipping into the Blue Lagoon10:51 What is The Blue Lagoon, anyway?13:25 The Waterfall14:46 The Smoothie Bar16:12 The Face Mask Bar18:44 Underwater Massages19:58 Other Crevices of the Blue Lagoon20:39 Steam Room and Dry Sauna21:35 The Silica Hotel22:26 The Silica Lagoon25:52 Outro"

At 8:33 a.m. CT, Starship successfully lifted off from the orbital launch pad for the first time. The vehicle cleared the pad and beach as Starship climbed to an apogee of ~39 km over the Gulf of Mexico – the highest of any Starship to-date. The vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test, lost altitude, and began to tumble. The flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship. As is standard procedure, the pad and surrounding area was cleared well in advance of the test, and we expect the road and beach near the pad to remain closed until tomorrow.With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship. Thank you to our customers, Cameron County, and the wider community for the continued support and encouragement. And congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting first flight test of Starship!"

His band played a tremendous role in shaping and inspiring contemporary guitar music from the 1990’s onwards. Noel’s continued success with the High Flying Birds cements his position as one of the most prolific and successful British songwriters of the last 50 years.Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds first emerged in 2011 with their eponymous album released in October of that year. The album went double platinum in the UK and has sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide. The release of the debut album was supported by a touring schedule covering 150 live shows in 32 countries.This was followed by ‘Chasing Yesterday’, released in March 2015 - the first album to be produced as well as written by Noel, with 122 further shows in 28 countries.A third album, ‘Who Built The Moon?’, was recorded in sessions spanning 2 years with renowned producer and composer David Holmes in Belfast and London released in November 2017.There followed a series of multi-genre EPs released over the course of 2019 and 2020, all receiving high critical acclaim.June 2021 saw the release of ‘Back The Way We Came: Vol 1 (2011-2021)’ - a Best Of celebrating a decade of Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds. This was the bands 4th consecutive Number 1 album and the 12th Number 1 album across Noel’s career. 2021 also saw Noel named as Record Store Day’s official ambassador.Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds played Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage in June 2022, delivering a career-spanning set to one of the weekend’s biggest crowds. The show was the culmination of a summer of acclaimed sold-out outdoor venues across the UK.Fast forward to 2023 and Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds are looking ahead to their much anticipated fourth studio album, ‘Council Skies’, due for release 2nd June. From the evocative album title to the cover art, to the lyrics themselves, ‘Council Skies’ sees Noel Gallagher bringing a more personal perspective, reclaiming his past and paying homage to his Mancunian roots. His most varied and accomplished solo record to date, Noel’s new album is a record framed by confidence, risk-taking, surefooted creative freedom, and great emotional depth.The first singles taken from the album - ‘Pretty Boy’ and ‘Easy Now’ - were met with a hail of critical and commercial success by fans and media alike. ‘Pretty Boy’ has also been remixed by The Cure’s Robert Smith, taking the track to a new spaced-out dimension.Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds commence touring in early June 20023 with a 26 date USA co-headline tour with Garbage before returning to the UK an extensive run of outdoor venues including a huge homecoming show at Manchester’s Wythenshawe Park before closing the year with an arena tour in December.#NoelGallagher #NGHFB #councilskies"
