Pictures presents “The Flash,” directed by Andy Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero’s first-ever standalone feature film.Worlds collide in “The Flash” when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he’s looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry’s only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? “The Flash” ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (“Bullet Train,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”), Ron Livingston (“Loudermilk,” “The Conjuring”), Maribel Verdú (“Elite,” “Y tu mamá también”), Kiersey Clemons (“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” “Sweetheart”), Antje Traue (“King of Ravens,” “Man of Steel”) and Michael Keaton (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Batman”).“The Flash” is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the “IT” films, “Mama”) and Michael Disco (“Rampage,” “San Andreas”). The screenplay is by Christina Hodson (“Birds of Prey,” “Bumblebee”), with a screen story by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein (“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and Joby Harold (“Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” “Army of the Dead”), based on characters from DC. The executive producers are Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.Joining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “The Suicide Squad”), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“IT Chapter Two,” “The Shape of Water”), editors Jason Ballantine (the “IT” films, “The Great Gatsby”) and Paul Machliss (“The Gentlemen,” “Baby Driver”), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (“Doctor Strange,” “Guardians of the Galaxy”); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“The Invisible Man,” the “IT” films).Warner Bros. Pictures presents a Double Dream/a Disco Factory production of an Andy Muschietti film, “The Flash.” It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures and is set to open in theaters in North America on June 16, 2023 and internationally beginning 14 June 2023."

Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes what Fallen Order did and wall-runs with it, then double-jumps and air-dashes straight into an epic lightsaber battle. Rather than taking us back to square one to begin Cal’s journey as a Padawan again, we’re trusted with control of a full-fledged Jedi Knight who we can grow into a master of superhuman mobility and fantastic and challenging combat. With a new set of larger, more diverse, and densely packed worlds to explore and a memorable cast of returning characters, Survivor tells a story that may be predictable at times but is still fun and emotional to watch play out. Launch performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars game. If Respawn makes one more like this it’ll be the best Star Wars trilogy in 30 years, hands down."

The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (“grown-ish”) as Ariel; Jonah Hauer-King (“A Dog’s Way Home”) as Prince Eric; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (“Hamilton”) as the voice of Sebastian; Awkwafina (“Raya and the Last Dragon”) as the voice of Scuttle; Jacob Tremblay (“Luca”) as the voice of Flounder; Noma Dumezweni (“Mary Poppins Returns”) as Queen Selina; Art Malik (“Homeland”) as Sir Grimsby; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men”) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?” “Bridesmaids”) as Ursula.       “The Little Mermaid” is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (“Chicago,” “Mary Poppins Returns”) with a screenplay by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (“Life of Pi,” “Finding Neverland”). The songs feature music from multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (“Beauty and the Beast,” “Aladdin”) and lyrics by Howard Ashman, and new lyrics by three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film is produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (“Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,” “Grease Live!”), Miranda, two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (“Tony Bennett: An American Classic”), and Rob Marshall, with Jeffrey Silver (“The Lion King”) serving as executive producer.

It's time for my annual bath - and for such an occasion, we decided to travel to most famous geothermal spa in Iceland - the Blue Lagoon. I've been wanting to unleash an international spa travel series for a long time - so here is my formal declaration: it's spa time, baby! So this past January, as the first installment of a 3-part Nordic/Scandinavian travel trip, we journeyed to the beautiful, mineral-rich light blue waters of the Blue Lagoon - to soak, smoothie, and face mask, oh my. Will this magical lagoon keep my skin plump and youthful forever? Or will the lava rock exfoliate my face right off? Who knows! Quick note - we mentioned that the Reykjanes lava field was 800 years old - I think it's actually much, much older than that - but the earliest recorded eruption was about 800 years ago (which is where our fact came from)!This video is NOT sponsored!Check out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.comMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​My TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?Tyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQwOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbigMUSICVia AudioNetworkPRODUCED & EDITED bySafiya NygaardTyler WilliamsDave SzametMelissa DouglasPhil KinneyBree von BradskyElizabeth PinottiAndrew LainhartIshara MathewsGFX by Dayana EspinozaCHAPTERS:0:00 Intro1:58 Flying to Iceland3:27 A Jet-lagged Day in Reykjavík5:46 The Blue Lagoon Retreat Hotel7:46 Prepping for the Blue Lagoon9:30 Dipping into the Blue Lagoon10:51 What is The Blue Lagoon, anyway?13:25 The Waterfall14:46 The Smoothie Bar16:12 The Face Mask Bar18:44 Underwater Massages19:58 Other Crevices of the Blue Lagoon20:39 Steam Room and Dry Sauna21:35 The Silica Hotel22:26 The Silica Lagoon25:52 Outro"

Check out the songs used in this video at https://www.tylerandtodd.com/playlist How did we get here? After a year of full time travel living the van life, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid home that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future.

At 8:33 a.m. CT, Starship successfully lifted off from the orbital launch pad for the first time. The vehicle cleared the pad and beach as Starship climbed to an apogee of ~39 km over the Gulf of Mexico – the highest of any Starship to-date. The vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test, lost altitude, and began to tumble. The flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship. As is standard procedure, the pad and surrounding area was cleared well in advance of the test, and we expect the road and beach near the pad to remain closed until tomorrow.With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship. Thank you to our customers, Cameron County, and the wider community for the continued support and encouragement. And congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting first flight test of Starship!"

PcJ79Yq6hvM,"HIGHLIGHTS | Arsenal vs Southampton (3-3) | Martinelli, Odegaard, Saka",2023-04-21T23:00:08Z,UCpryVRk_VDudG8SHXgWcG0w,Arsenal,17,23.27.04,2904620,37339,3392,False,False,"Two late goals from Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka managed to salvage a point against Southampton, but could only ensure we claimed a third draw in succession.We got off to the worst possible start when Carlos Alcaraz netted within the first 30 seconds, and then on 14 minutes Theo Walcott came back to haunt his former club to hand us a mountain to climb.Gabriel Martinelli’s 15th goal of the season reduced the arrears before half-time, however Duje Caleta-Car restored the two-goal cushion on 65 minutes and as we entered the final five minutes it looked like a loss was on the cards.However the skipper fired in from range before Saka pounced to prod home a loose ball in the final minute of normal time to grab a share of the spoils in unlikely circumstances.Things started to go wrong just 27 seconds into the game when Aaron Ramsdale attempted to pass out from the back but didn’t spot Alcaraz, who snuck in to intercept, control and fire the ball into the bottom corner to stun the home crowd.Their shock quickly turned to encouragement as they tried to rally the players and some direct running by the electric Martinelli led to chances for Odegaard and Oleksandr Zinchenko who failed to hit the target, but the visitors piled further early misery on us by moving 2-0 ahead.Alcaraz was again involved, picking the ball up in the middle and feeding it into the path of Walcott, who did what he did so often in our colours by tucking the chance away first-time into the bottom corner and put us deep in trouble.We needed a quick response, and it arrived six minutes later as Martinelli gave us a lifeline. Saka tricked his way past Romain Perraud and did well not only to keep the ball in play, but find our top scorer who produced some great movement to get free and flash home a volley that reignited our chances.We couldn’t afford any further mishaps and only a double save by Ramsdale to deny Mohammed Elyanoussi and Alcaraz kept the deficit at one, but as a frantic opening quarter began to settle, we kept probing in and around the visitors’ area and Gabriel would head over on the stroke of half-time.Then in stoppage-time Ben White flicked a Saka corner goalwards which was brilliantly cleared off the line by the back-peddling Alcaraz, and then Gabriel Jesus saw an attempt blocked in the box as we went into the break down, but not out.At half-time Ruben Selles tightened things up by moving to a five-man defence, and that saw our opportunities dry up. With it being hard enough to score once to grab a draw, a hammer blow to our title chances arrived midway through the second half when the Saints added their third.On a rare foray forward in the second half, James Ward-Prowse swung over a corner which was flicked on by Armel Bella-Kotchap, and Calta-Car headed the ball past Ramsdale to dampen the mood.A golden chance fell to Jesus straight away when he was picked out in space at the far post by compatriot Martinelli but he couldn’t keep his attempt down, and as was the story after the break we couldn’t find a way through a stubborn Southampton defence, despite plenty of pressure.With three minutes to play, we managed to claw our way back into contention when Odegaard played a one-two with White and bent the ball home from the edge of the box to make it 3-2, and incredibly two minutes later we got ourselves level.Reiss Nelson picked up the ball in a dangerous position on the left and fired towards the bottom corner. Gavin Bazunu did well to get down low and keep it out, but Saka tucked home the rebound to get the Emirates rocking.Eight minutes of stoppage time provided even more noise, and we were fractions away from completing an incredible comeback when Leandro Trossard let fly from range and struck the crossbar, meaning there wasn’t quite to be a Bournemouth-esque ending this time as we were forced to settle for a point.#arsenal Enjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka, Vivianne Miedema, Leah Williamson,Gabriel Jesus, Alex Zinchenko, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Beth Mead, Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White, and more.Subscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtubeFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebookFollow us on Twitter: http://arsn.al/twitterFollow us on Instagram: http://arsn.al/instagramFollow us on TikTok: http://arsn.al/tiktok"

We do things differently here so please read these rules carefully. These show not only how to behave on stream, but should serve as a guideline for if you wish to call yourself kindred.STREAM ETIQUETTEA. Please keep chat relevant to the stream and do not spam, troll or discuss controversial or offensive topics.B. Do not mention another streamer unless I bring them up first, nor should you mention me in any other chat unless I am mentioned first.C. All languages are welcome here, and you will be timed out if you ask people to stop talking in a certain language.D. Absolutely no spoilers or backseating unless directly asked for.E. Do not trauma dump in any way. If you use a supa to do so it will be deleted and I will ignore it. If you are struggling, please seek professional help or call someone, help is available, and you aren't alone; https://www.helpguide.org/find-aelp.htmF. Use emotes in chat as often as you like, but keep a limit of three per message.G. If you’d like to send supas, please use either your own currency, or, if you can’t, use one that is of similar value. Supas that misuse of another country's currency will be ignored, unless they are from Kindred who come from that country.RESPECTWhen engaging in other parts of the internet, respect those spaces and, if presenting as a kindred, do so with the politeness and kindness you would show other kindred. No matter how much you love being a kindred or love me, never use your passion for this community as an excuse to flame or attack others. If you do so, I do not want your support. You’re also welcome to ship me with anyone you like (with their permission of course) but please remember that your ship is only a fantasy and not to let it influence your world-view.RESPONSIBILITYYou are welcome (even encouraged) to treat these streams as a source of warmth, happiness and community. If you associate these feelings with me and develop an attachment, that’s okay too. However, if you become too attached to the degree that it becomes unhealthy or parasocial, I trust you to seek help and to find happiness elsewhere. If you can do this, it will not offend me and I will be proud of you. You’re welcome back anytime as long as your engagement is done so with regards to your health.ACCOUNTABILITYLearn the difference between criticism and hate. Ignore hate, and if it’s in our chat, we’ll remove it. Honest criticism however is welcome and I trust all kindred to listen to criticism and assess it fairly. There is NEVER an excuse to bicker, fight or become defensive when someone wants to help. However, if you’d like to give criticism, please save it for YouTube comments after stream.━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━⏰【Luxiem】【Vox Akuma ヴォックス・アクマ】https://twitter.com/Vox_Akumahttps://www.reddit.com/user/Vox_Akuma【Mysta Rias】https://twitter.com/Mysta_Riashttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIM92Ok_spNKLVB5TsgwseQ【Ike Eveland】https://twitter.com/ike_evelandhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yNIKGvy-YUrwYupVdLDXA【Shu Yamino】https://twitter.com/shu_yaminohttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG0rzBZV_QMP4MtWg6IjhEA【Luca Kaneshiro】https://twitter.com/luca_kaneshirohttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Gb7Uawe20QyFibhLl1lzA■ For more information, visit: ・ NIJISANJI Official YouTube (EN): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-JS... ・ NIJISANJI Official Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/nijisanji_en ・ NIJISANJI Official Twitter (English account): https://twitter.com/NIJISANJI_World ・ANYCOLOR Official Website: https://www.anycolor.co.jp/ ・ NIJISANJI Official Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Nijisanji/ ・ NIJISANJI Official Instagram: https://instagram.com/nijisanji_en ・ NIJISANJI Official Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@nijisanji_en?... ・ NIJISANJI Official Facebook (English account): https://www.facebook.com/nijisanji.of... ・ NIJISANJI Official YouTube (JP): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7Y...▽　Guidance for minorshttps://www.anycolor.co.jp/notice-for-minors-en▽　For Business and PR Inquiries https://www.anycolor.co.jp/en/contact"

Fast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema’s most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.Over many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they’ve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who’s fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything—and everyone—that Dom loves, forever.   In 2011’s Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price.  Dante’s plot will scatter Dom’s family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante’s vengeance.  Directed by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar® winner Helen Mirren and Oscar® winner Charlize Theron.  The film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar® winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn’t hold the same fondness for Dom’s crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom’s past; and legendary Oscar® winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia’s Abuelita Toretto.  Fast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.comOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSagaInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSagaTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSagaTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsagaOfficial Motion Picture Soundtrack Pre-Save: https://fastx.lnk.to/soundtrack!TrailerGasolina Remix: https://fastx.lnk.to/GasolinaRemix!FastX"
