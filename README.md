## API & Webscraping: Youtube Trending Videos


The main objective of this project was to obtain and enrich data through web scraping techniques. The collected data was organised, cleaned and analysed to gain insights about the trending videos on YouTube.

Specifically, we focused on the following key areas:

1\. Trending categories in 2017 and 2018:\
We conducted an evaluation of the trending video categories over time, specifically for the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. By analysing the data, we identified the most popular categories during those years.

2\. Views and comments in 2017 and 2018:\
To understand the engagement levels, we analysed the views and comments statistics over time, per video category, for the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This analysis allowed us to identify the categories that collected more views and elicited the most interactions from viewers.

3\. Daily analysis of trending videos:\
In addition to the yearly analysis, we conducted a comprehensive daily analysis of trending videos for Portugal, Brazil, Spain, Kenya, and Nepal. By comparing categories, views, and comments, we gained valuable insights into the preferences and trends specific to these countries. This enabled us to understand the dynamics of video consumption and audience engagement across diverse regions.

Overall, this project has provided valuable insights into the world of trending videos on YouTube. The findings from our data analysis shed light on the most popular categories, viewership trends, and audience engagement, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of YouTube's dynamic ecosystem.
